            <h1>About us</h1>
            <p>Openness&#8218; accountability&#8218; and honesty define government transparency&#8228; In a free society&#8218;
                transparency is government's obligation to share information with citizens&#8228; It is at the heart of
                how citizens hold their public officials accountable&#8228; Here at TGIF we believe that government
                should
                be transparent&#8228;
            </p>
            <p>Governments exist to serve the people&#8228; Information on how officials conduct the public business and
                spend taxpayer money must be readily available and easily understood&#8228; This transparency allows
                good
                and just governance&#8228; Transparency promotes accountability and provides information for citizens
                about
                what their Government is doing&#8228;
            </p>
            <p>We also believe that government should be participatory&#8228; Public engagement enhances the
                Government's
                effectiveness and improves the quality of its decisions&#8228; Knowledge is widely dispersed in society&#8218;
                and public officials benefit from having access to that dispersed knowledge&#8228; We invite you to use
                our site to become actively engaged in American government&#8228;
            </p>
            <p>TGIF works to disclose information in forms that the public can readily find and use&#8228; We solicit
                public
                feedback to identify information of greatest use to the public&#8228;
            </p>
            <h4>Background History of Government Transparency</h4>
            <span>In the West&#8218; the idea that government should be open to public scrutiny and susceptible to public
                    opinion dates back at least to the time of the <span id="dots">...</span></span>
            <div id="more">
                    <span>Enlightenment&#8218; when many philosophies made an attack on absolutist
                    doctrine of state secrecy&#8218; a core part of their intellectual project&#8228; The passage of formal legislative
                    instruments to this end can also be traced to this time with Sweden&#8218; for example&#8218; &#40;which then included
                    Finland as a Swedish&#8208;governed territory&#41; enacting free press legislation as part of its constitution
                    &#40;Freedom of the Press Act&#8218; 1766&#41;&#8228; This approach&#8218; and that of the philosophies more broadly&#8218; is strongly
                    related to recent historiography on the eighteenth&#8208;century public sphere&#8228;</span>
                <p></p>
                <p>Influenced by Enlightenment
                    thought&#8218; the revolutions in America &#40;1776&#41; and France &#40;1789&#41;&#8218; freedom of
                    the press enshrined provisions
                    and requirements for public budgetary accounting and freedom of the press in constitutional articles&#8228;
                    In the nineteenth century&#8218; attempts by Metternichean statesmen to row back on these measures
                    were v
                    igorously opposed by a number of eminent liberal politicians and writers&#8218; Bentham&#8218; Mill
                    and Acton
                    prominent among the latter&#8228;</p>
                <p>Open government is widely seen to be a key hallmark of contemporary democratic practice and is often
                    linked to the passing of freedom of information legislation&#8228; Scandinavian countries claim to
                    have adopted the first freedom of information legislation&#8218; dating the origins of its modern
                    provisions to the eighteenth century and Finland continuing the presumption of openness after
                    gaining
                    independence in 1917&#8218; passing its Act on Publicity of Official Documents in 1951&#40;superseded
                    by new legislation in 1999&#41;&#8228;</p>
                <p>The United States passed its Freedom of Information Act&#40;FOIA&#41; in 1966&#8218; FOIAs&#8218;
                    Access to Information Acts &#40;AIAs&#41; or equivalent laws were passed in Denmark and Norway in
                    1970&#8228;</p>
